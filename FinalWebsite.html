    <h1> Ormiston Chess Club: A Community Built on Strategy </h1>
        <div>
        <p class= "test"> Founded in 2011, the Ormiston Chess Club quickly became a cornerstone for chess lovers across the area. What began as a small group of friends passionate about chess has grown into a thriving club welcoming players of all skill levels—from absolute beginners to seasoned competitors. 
        Every Friday evening, members gather at the Ormiston Community Center to dive into games that test wit, patience, and strategy. The club offers weekly coaching sessions, puzzle challenges, and friendly tournaments designed to sharpen players’ skills and foster a welcoming atmosphere.
        One of the club’s highlights is the annual “Ormiston Blitz Night,” where fast-paced games bring excitement and laughter as players race against the clock. The club also takes pride in its youth program, encouraging young minds to develop critical thinking and sportsmanship through chess.
        Ormiston Chess Club stands as a vibrant community where the timeless game of chess connects people, inspires learning, and builds lasting friendships—making every move count since 2011</p>
